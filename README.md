## Chromed Bird ##

1. What is it?

    Chromed Bird is a general purpose Chromium twitter extension.

2. Installing

    Just head to http://github.com/cezarsa/chromed_bird/downloads and download the latest .crx file. After that, autoupdate will start working and you won't have to worry about future releases.

3. Compatibility

    Currently only Dev channel releases of Google Chrome support extensions. Check http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel.

4. Features

    Chromed Bird is only starting but it already lets you do basic stuff like view your friends timeline, compose tweets, and replying and retweeting. Let's try to summarize this:

    * Follow your friends timeline and navigate through older tweets
    * Tweets caching to avoid hitting Twitter's API rate limit (Only hit Twitter after 1 minute or when fetching uncached pages)
    * Compose, reply, and RT tweets
    * It uses Chromium autoupdate feature, so you won't be left behind.

5. Wishlist

    There are lots of missing stuff, some of them seem to be limitations from Chromium's current extensions API.

    * It should automatically notify on new tweets, but I couldn't find a way to open a popup from the background page.
    * It'd be nice to track read / unread tweets.
    * There seem to be some issues with popup window resizing, it doesn't shrink back as content shrinks.
    * Use OAuth authentication (Although I think it's a little cumbersome to have users copying and pasting the PIN number)

6. License

    Any of these open source ones. I mean, you're free to do whatever you want with it. If you're using some of the source code I only kindly ask that you mention where it came from.
